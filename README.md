# Python_HKCA_TGBot

## Motivation
When the scheme came out everyone is asking questions repetitively so I thought could I do something to help.
I wrote this bot to help Hongkongers to help themselves for application of Open Work Permit.
I also added some daily life features like crawling currency rate, COVID stats etc.
The bot was first hosted on my Jetson Nano at home but later migrated to Google Cloud Platform.

Including but not limited to
- Readme
- Application Procedures
- Deadline Calculation
- NOC CLass lookup
